# read-APS-inverters
This project is intended for reading APS Systems inverters. The program can pair and poll YC600 and QS1 inverters, up to 9 peaces. The read values are displayed on a web page and sent via mosquitto in a Json format.
The program has a lot of smart features. All settings can be done via the webinterface. It has a console that can be used for debugging and sending/receiving zigbee messages

## the hardware
It is nothing more than an esp device like nodemcu or its relatives and a prepared cc2530, cc2531 zigbee module. And a powersupply.
The zigbeemodule should be flashed with a firmware that can be found here https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/4221

## how does it work
The APS system works with a separate zigbee implementation. The ESP-ECU sends zigbee requests to the inverters an analyzes the answers, extracting the values. 
The ESP communicates with the zigbee module through the alternative serial port.
The ESP-ECU starts a coordinator (an entity that can start a zigbee network). The coordinator binds the inverters and sends the poll requests to them.
The interesting values are send via mqtt and displayed on the main page.
